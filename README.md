# DuckDuckGo AI Chat Button Plugin for Firefox

The idea was to create a button that would enable a quick way to send a DDG Chat AI question and get an immediate response with a click and typing some text in a field.

## Project Status

So far, this project creates a button that can be placed on the firefox toolbar, that when clicked will take a Firefox user to the DuckDuckGo Chat AI chat session.

## Project Tasks

- [ ] Add a popup that contains a field with proper styling as a mockup of the UI that will be used to submit the DDG Chat AI question
- [ ] Hook the field up with the proper command to submit the question to the proper URL to initiate the chat with the question already submitted.
